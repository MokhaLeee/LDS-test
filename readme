The goal of this repository is to provide an example for linking two pieces of data to the same address simultaneously. A typical scenario is where both pieces of data need to be considered as independent data starting at address 0, but each piece contains pointers to the other.

The main goal of this test is to build independently compressed data for each GBAFE banim.
